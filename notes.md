Hey folks, here is what I learned how to do in class. I learned how to make a github repository, and stick it on my computer. Yup. I also got to learn how to open it all up in vscode, which is kinda cool. It seems like GIthub is just a google drive for my code, which is pretty neat. I'm eating an orange right now, not sure what else to put here, all my notes are in obsidian. If you aren't using obsidian, check it out, coolest note taking software out there. 2 best parts, free, and community plugins.

# HTML Startup
___
## HTML pages for each component of your application
- I have a page for login, the main goal page, and a popup page for adding friends

## Proper use of HTML tags including BODY, NAV, MAIN, HEADER, FOOTER
- Yup, did this.

## Links between pages as necessary
 - My login page automatically links to the main page upon clicking submit, and you can navigate between my pages using the navigation bar and buttons throughout the app.

## Application textual content
Well, I did my best to write everything out.

## Placeholder for 3rd party service calls
There will be an inspirational quote that changes everyday at the bottom of the goals page, this will be pulled from 3rd party.

## Application images
My app is a pretty simplistic design, no images that I know of yet, so I added a few simple ones for fun, a + image that I turned into a button as well as I added an icon to my pages.

## Login placeholder, including user name display
I have a login page, and the usuername will be displayed on the user's goal card.

## Database data placeholder showing content stored in the database
The goals that are on each goal card will be stored in the database.

## bWebSocket data placeholder showing where realtime communication will go
The goals on your friend's goal cards will update live, so the moment your friend completes a goal or adds a new one, you will be able to see it.
